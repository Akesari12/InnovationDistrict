abstract = {{<p>}One approach to urban areas emphasizes the existence of certain immutable relationships, such as{</p>}
{<p>}Zipf{\textquoteright}s or Gibrat{\textquoteright}s Law. An alternative view is that urban change reflects individual responses to changing{</p>}
{<p>}tastes or technologies. This paper examines almost 200 years of regional change in the U.S. and finds{</p>}
{<p>}that few, if any, growth relationships remain constant, including Gibrat{\textquoteright}s Law. Education does a reasonable{</p>}
{<p>}job of explaining urban resilience in recent decades, but does not seem to predict county growth a{</p>}
{<p>}century ago. After reviewing this evidence, we present and estimate a simple model of regional change,{</p>}
{<p>}where education increases the level of entrepreneurship. Human capital spillovers occur at the city{</p>}
{<p>}level because skilled workers produce more product varieties and thereby increase labor demand. We{</p>}
{<p>}find that skills are associated with growth in productivity or entrepreneurship, not with growth in quality{</p>}
{<p>}of life, at least outside of the West. We also find that skills seem to have depressed housing supply{</p>}
{<p>}growth in the West, but not in other regions, which supports the view that educated residents in that{</p>}
{<p>}region have fought for tougher land-use controls. We also present evidence that skills have had a disproportionately{</p>}
{<p>}large impact on unemployment during the current recession.{</p>}}

abstract = {{<p>}We use new establishment-level data and geographic mapping methods to improve upon evaluations of{</p>}
{<p>}the effectiveness of state enterprise zones, focusing on California{\textquoteright}s program. Because zone boundaries do{</p>}
{<p>}not follow census tracts or zip codes, we created digitized maps of original zone boundaries and later{</p>}
{<p>}expansions. We combine these maps with geocoded observations on most businesses located in California.{</p>}
{<p>}The evidence indicates that enterprise zones do not increase employment. We also find no shift of{</p>}
{<p>}employment toward the lower-wage workers targeted by enterprise zone incentives. We conclude that{</p>}
{<p>}the program is ineffective in achieving its primary goals.{</p>}}

date-added = {2017-08-03T22:51:01GMT},
abstract = {{<p>}Popular discussions often treat the great housing boom of the 1996-2006 period as if it were a national{</p>}
{<p>}phenomenon with similar impacts across locales, but across metropolitan areas, price growth was dramatically{</p>}
{<p>}higher in warmer, less educated cities with less initial density and higher initial housing values. Within{</p>}
{<p>}metropolitan areas, price growth was faster in neighborhoods closer to the city center. The centralization{</p>}
{<p>}of price growth during the boom was particularly dramatic in those metropolitan areas where income{</p>}
{<p>}is higher away from the city center. We consider four different explanations for why city centers grew{</p>}
{<p>}more quickly when wealth was more suburbanized: (1) gentrification, which brings rapid price growth,{</p>}
{<p>}is more common in areas with centralized poverty; (2) areas with centralized poverty had more employment{</p>}
{<p>}concentration which led to faster centralized price growth; (3) areas with centralized poverty had the{</p>}
{<p>}weakest supply response to the boom in prices in the city center; and (4) poverty is centralized in cities{</p>}
{<p>}with assets, like public transit, at the city center that became more valuable over the boom. We find{</p>}
{<p>}some support for several of these hypotheses, but taken together they explain less than half of the overall{</p>}
{<p>}connection between centralized poverty and centralized price growth.{</p>}}

date-added = {2017-08-03T23:35:16GMT},
abstract = {{<p>}Over the past 30 years, eastern Massachusetts has seen a remarkable combination of rising home prices{</p>}
{<p>}and declining supply of new homes, which doesn{\textquoteright}t appear to reflect any lack of land. In this paper, we{</p>}
{<p>}examine the increasing number of land-use regulations in Greater Boston. These regulations vary widely{</p>}
{<p>}over space, and are hard to predict with any variables other than historical density levels. Minimum{</p>}
{<p>}lot size and other land use controls are associated with reductions in new construction activity. These{</p>}
{<p>}regulations are associated with higher prices when we do not control for contemporary density and{</p>}
{<p>}demographics, but not when we add these contemporaneous controls. These results are compatible with{</p>}
{<p>}economic theory, which predicts that production restraints on a good won{\textquoteright}t increase the price of that{</p>}
{<p>}good relative to sufficiently close substitutes. Current density levels appear to be too low to maximize{</p>}

date-added = {2017-08-03T23:37:37GMT},
abstract = {{<p>}Many industries are geographically concentrated. Many mechanisms that could account for such agglomeration{</p>}
{<p>}have been proposed. We note that these theories make different predictions about which pairs of industries{</p>}
{<p>}should be coagglomerated. We discuss the measurement of coagglomeration and use data from the{</p>}
{<p>}Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database from 1972 to 1997 to compute pairwise coagglomeration{</p>}
{<p>}measurements for U.S. manufacturing industries. Industry attributes are used to construct measures{</p>}
{<p>}of the relevance of each of Marshall's three theories of industry agglomeration to each industry pair:{</p>}
{<p>}(1) agglomeration saves transport costs by proximity to input suppliers or final consumers, (2) agglomeration{</p>}
{<p>}allows for labor market pooling, and (3) agglomeration facilitates intellectual spillovers. We assess{</p>}
{<p>}the importance of the theories via regressions of coagglomeration indices on these measures. Data{</p>}
{<p>}on characteristics of corresponding industries in the United Kingdom are used as instruments. We{</p>}
{<p>}find evidence to support each mechanism. Our results suggest that input-output dependencies are the{</p>}
